# PCA_experimentation_HUMBAP_Kidney_Segmentation
The goal is to identify and segment the glomeruli in human kidney images using U-net Segmentation Model and obtain maximum possible values of performance metrics and compare and analyze performance of different PCs applied to the same model by reducing the dimension of the data such that computation complexity decreases.
